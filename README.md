## About
Seaside Heights mobile weather dashboard

My family and I were visiting Seaside Heights, NJ and I was sick of not knowing if the ocean was going to be fun or not. So using [NOAA tide data](http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/noaatidepredictions/NOAATidesFacade.jsp?Stationid=8533071) and [forecast.io](https://developer.forecast.io) I made a simple utility that'll tell me.

Live at [seaside.pw](http://seaside.pw).

## Installation instructions:
+ clone
+ npm install
+ add your forecast.io API key to"config.js.example" and change it to "config.js"
